                        to the interest Ester showed in music and dance at a very young age, her mother gave up her

                        Bharatnatyam and Carnatic
                        singing.
                        At the age of 14, she established her independent musical live show with the title "Ester Show"
                        which was in aid of the
                        Mangalore Diocesan Medical relief fund. <br><br>
                        Ester was a bright student academically and passed the 10th std with a distinction. Due to her
                        interest in the social
                        sciences and her drive to do something for the society, she dreamed on getting into civil
                        services for which she planned
                        on pursuing her studies in Arts. She along with her mother then shifted to Mumbai where she
                        joined the prestigious St.

                        <br>
                        Even as she shifted to Mumbai she continued to keep training in music and dance and shows
                        whenever possible. During the
                        college phase she got trained in Hindustani singing under Ustad Hafiz Khan, Mumbai. She produced
                        and released her maiden

                        composed and sung by herself
                        at the age of 16.
                        <br>
                        It was during one of her Bharatnatyam shows in Bangalore, that the legendary Bollywood
                        choreographer Saroj Khan laid her
                        eyes upon Ester. She noticed the talent and the potential in her and advised her to try her luck
                        in films. Ester went on
                        to get trained in Kathak and Bollywood dancing under Saroj Khan for around 2 yrs during which
                        she got introduced to the
                        world of movie making and related people.
                        Ester then joined Anupam Kher's 'Actor Prepares',the school of acting where she completed her
                        Diploma course in acting.

                        Ester was initially hesitant about getting into films as an actor as that field was yet to be
                        explored by her. During
                        this time was when her Guru, Saroj Khan offered her to work in a non- commercial Hindi movie
                        "Baromas" she herself was
                        choreographing. Ester, along with her mother's support and her Master ji's insistence took it
                        up. And from then on there
                        was no looking back. Baromas went on to be played and nominated in various countries and film
                        festivals around the world
                        including the 2012 South Asian International Film Festival in New York and the DCIFF (DC
                        Independent Film Festival) in
                        Washington, DC. It was the only Indian movie to be selected and competing in feature films
                        category against films from
                        USA, Switzerland, UK and Canada. She was then casted by the renowned Director Teja in his Telugu
                        movie "1000 Abaddalu"
                        in 2013 which went on to be a hit and Ester was immediately signed by the prestigious 'Suresh
                        Productions' for their
                        Golden jubilee project "Bhimavaram Bullodu" opposite Hero Sunil Verma. The project was in
                        celebration of the 50th year
                        of the production house and it turned out to be a massive hit completing 50 successful days in
                        theaters across Andhra
                        Pradesh and Telangana thus making Ester Noronha popular and loved by the audience in the Telugu
